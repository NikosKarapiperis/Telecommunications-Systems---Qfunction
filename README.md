# Telecommunications-Systems---Qfunction
This is a project i had to implement in the course of Telecommunication Systems[2022-2023]. I had to use Python with numpy, scipy and matplotlib.pyplot libraries. This project is separate into two parts. In the first part, I compared the Qfunction with some approximate functions. In the second part, I created M-PAM waveforms.

# First step, make sure that Python and pip is preinstalled on your system

# Check Python version
```bash
python --version
```
# Check pip version
```bash
pip -V
```

# Install numpy library
```bash
pip install numpy
```

# Install scipy library
```bash
python -m pip install scipy
```
# Install scipy library Ubuntu and Debian
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-scipy
```

# Install matplotlib.plot library
```bash
pip install matplotlib
```
