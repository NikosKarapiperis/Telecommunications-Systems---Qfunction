# Telecommunications-Systems---Qfunction
This is a project i had to implement in the course of Telecommunication Systems[2022-2023]. I had to use Python with numpy, scipy and matplotlib.pyplot libraries. This project is separate into two parts. In the first part, I compared the Qfunction with some approximate functions. In the second part, I created M-PAM waveforms.
